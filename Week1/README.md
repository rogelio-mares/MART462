# MART462 Week 1

While using bubble i thought the tutorial was pretty easy to follow, at first it was pretty confusing because they put you right in with no experience. But it was pretty interesting to see all the stuff you can include, i enjoyed following along with the tutorial but i wish i still had some more experience before going in
