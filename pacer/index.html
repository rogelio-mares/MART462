<h3>Pacer</h3>

<button class="accordion"  style="color: #0f66c9;">What is Pacer?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p style="font-size: 15pt"  style="color: rgb(138, 138, 138);">Pacer is a running-tracking and social media app designed for
   runners: Connecting, tracking, and competing. Users can
   track their fitness via GPS within the app, or log their fitness
   manually, among other features. Pacer allows you to set
   workout goals and weekly commitments. That can include
   targets for the amount of time you spend training, the
   distance you run, or the number of calories you want to burn.
   What distinguishes Pacer from other fitness apps is its elegant
   user interface and “social fitness” platform. In addition to
   providing useful statistics and visualizations of exercise data.
   Pacer allows users to socialize, motivate, and compete via
   online and mobile apps. Individuals can use these features to
   improve their performance and gain new insights into their
   workout routines. One important feature to note is that
   although it runs in the background of your phone, the app has
   been optimised so that it doesn’t drain your battery life like a
   lot of similar apps. In addition to the mobile app, Pacer
   provides an API that allows 3rd party apps to integrate with
   their services. These services allow users to share their data on
   personal sites, provide enhanced analytical tools, and many
   other features.</p>
